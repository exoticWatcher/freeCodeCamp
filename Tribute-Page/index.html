          <h3 id="about">Who is Larry King?</h3>

          <p>Larry King (born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger; November 19, 1933 – January 23, 2021) was an American television
            and radio host, whose awards included 2 Peabodys, an Emmy and 10 Cable ACE Awards. Over his career, he
            hosted over 50,000 interviews.


            <br><br>
            His easygoing interviewing style helped make Larry King Live (1985–2010) one of CNN’s longest-running and
            most popular programs.

          <p>King was born in Brooklyn on November 19, 1933. He was one of two children of Jennie (1900–1976), a garment
            worker who was born in Minsk, Russian Empire, and Aaron Zeiger (1896–1943), a restaurant owner and
            defense-plant worker who was born in Pinsk, Russian Empire. His parents were Orthodox Jews who immigrated to
            the United States from Belarus in the 1930s.
            <br><br>
            King attended Lafayette High School, a public high school in Brooklyn. When King was nine years old, his
            father died of a heart attack. This resulted in King, his mother, and brother going on government welfare.
            King was greatly affected by his father's death, and subsequently lost interest in his schoolwork.
            <br><br>
            After graduating from high school, King worked to help support his mother. From an early age, he desired to
            work in radio broadcasting.

          <h4>Miami radio and television</h4>
          <p>A CBS staff announcer, whom King met by chance, suggested he go to Florida which was a growing media market
            with openings for inexperienced broadcasters. King went to Miami, and after initial setbacks, he gained his
            first job in radio. The manager of a small station, WAHR (now WMBM) in Miami Beach, hired him to clean up
            and perform miscellaneous tasks. When one of the station's announcers abruptly quit, King was put on the
            air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, working as the disc jockey from 9 a.m. to noon. He also did two
            afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $50 a week.
            <br><br>
            He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager claimed that Zeiger was too difficult to remember,
            so minutes before airtime, Larry chose the surname King, which he got from an advertisement in the Miami
            Herald for King's Wholesale Liquor. Within two years, he legally changed his name to Larry King.
            <br><br>
            He began to conduct interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD, at Pumpernik's Restaurant in Miami Beach. He
            would interview whoever walked in. His first interview was with a waiter at the restaurant. Two days later,
            singer Bobby Darin, in Miami for a concert that evening, walked into Pumpernik's having heard King's radio
            show; Darin became King's first celebrity interview guest.
            <br><br>
            King's Miami radio show brought him local attention. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted Miami
            Undercover, airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now WPLG).
            <br><br>
            King credited his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason, whose national
            television variety show was being taped in Miami Beach beginning in 1964. "That show really took off because
            Gleason came to Miami," King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of
            Fame. "He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the
            set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed
            the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine."
            <br><br>
            During this period, WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the
            National Football League, during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season. However, he was dismissed
            by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator as of December
            20, 1971, when he was arrested after being accused of grand larceny by a former business partner, Louis
            Wolfson. Other staff covered the Dolphins' games into their 24–3 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI. King also
            lost his weekly column at the Miami Beach Sun newspaper. The charges were dropped. Eventually, King was
            rehired by WIOD. For several years during the 1970s, he hosted a sports talk-show called "Sports-a-la-King"
            that featured guests and callers.
